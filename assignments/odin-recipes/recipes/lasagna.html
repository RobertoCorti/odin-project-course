            <ol>
                <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
                <li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and cook until they are softened and lightly browned.</li>
                <li>Add the ground beef to the skillet and cook until it is browned and cooked through. Drain any excess fat.</li>
                <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper. Simmer the sauce for about 10 minutes, allowing the flavors to blend together.</li>
                <li>In a separate bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, grated Parmesan cheese, chopped parsley, and beaten egg. Mix well.</li>
                <li>Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
                <li>Place 3 lasagna noodles on top of the sauce.</li>
                <li>Spread half of the ricotta cheese mixture evenly over the noodles.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle a third of the shredded mozzarella cheese over the ricotta layer.</li>
                <li>Repeat the layers with half of the remaining meat sauce, 3 more noodles, the remaining ricotta cheese mixture, and another third of the shredded mozzarella cheese.</li>
                <li>Place the final 3 lasagna noodles on top and cover them with the remaining meat sauce.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle the remaining shredded mozzarella cheese on top, and if desired, sprinkle a little more grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
                <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil, making sure it is tightly sealed.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for 25 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
                <li>Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving.</li>
                <li>Slice the lasagna into portions and serve hot. Enjoy!</li>
